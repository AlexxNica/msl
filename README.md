# Message Security Layer

Message Security Layer (MSL) is an extensible and flexible secure messaging protocol that can be used to transport data between two or more communicating entities. Data may also be associated with specific users, and treated as confidential or non-replayable if so desired.

## Documentation

The [MSL Protocol](https://github.com/Netflix/msl/wiki/) provides a complete description of the protocol and implementation requirements. The [Configuration Guide](https://github.com/Netflix/msl/wiki/Configuration-Guide) presents some common client and server MSL configurations.

The set of public interfaces and classes an application must implement and use is documented in the [Public Javadoc](http://netflix.github.com/msl/javadoc-public/). Documentation on all of the code, including internal classes and private methods, can be found in the full [Javadoc](http://netflix.github.com/msl/javadoc/).
