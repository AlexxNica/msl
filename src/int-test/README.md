# MSL Integration Tests

MSL integration tests mainly concentrate on executing end-to-end communication between client and server using MSL protocol.

  ## Setup

  Server part of the code can simply be hosted in any Java application server (Ex: Tomcat).
  Client part of the code uses TestNG framework and can be run individually as needed.
