mslclient

NAME
	mslclient - start MSL CLI client

SYNOPSIS
	mslclient [options]

DESCRIPTION
	mslclient is a tool to send MSL messages to a server, using common client configuration options
	supported by MSL core library.

        mslclient can run in interactive and non-interactive modes. Non-interactive mode allows sending
	single message to the server. Interactive mode allows sending multiple messages and interactive
	change of configuration before sending each message.

OPTIONS
	All options start with "-". No option value can start with "-" unless "-" is an entire value.
        Specifying "-" value in non-interactive mode is illegal. Specifying "-" value in interactive mode
	results in deleting the corresponding option from the current options list. All values are mandatory
	unless explicitly marked as OPTIONAL or having the default value.

	-int (true|false), default false
		OPTIONAL. Make mslclient run in interactive (true) or non-interactive (false) modes.

		In non-interactive mode a single message is sent to a server; all required options
		must be set from the command line.

		In interactive mode the configuration is first populated from the command-line arguments.
		Then a user is repetitively presented with the "cmd>" prompt, from which parameters can
		be entered to alter the existing configuration, by deleting, adding, or changing, the
		existing options, following the exact same syntax as in the command-line arguments.
		Pressing ENTER upon completion of parameters entry results in sending a message to the
		server. Pressing ENTER without entering any parameters results in sending the same payload
		under the same configuration.

	-cfg <configuration-file-path>
		Path to the existing configuration file. Read the comments in the supplied mslcli.cfg
		configuration file to understand what each parameter means and how this file can be
		changed to support your specific needs.
		Notice: configuration file can only be set once and only from the command-line.

	-url <server-url>
		The URL of the server to send messages to.

	-eid <entity-id>
		Client entity id string with no spaces in it. The value must have presence in the configuration
		file by defining its allowed entity authentication scheme(s), key exchange scheme(s), etc. 

	-uid <user-id>
		OPTIONAL. User id internal to a given mslclient configuration. It is typically used for
		forming user authentication data in a MSL request, in order to acquire UserIdToken.

	-kx <supported-key-exchange-scheme>
		The following are the allowed values:
		dh - for Diffie-Hellman key exchange
		sw - for Symmetric Wrapped key exchange
		aw - for Asymmetric Wrapped key exchange
		jwe - for JSON Web Encryption Ladder Key Exchange
		jwl - for JSON Web Key Ladder Key Exchange

	-kxm <supported-key-exchange-mechanism>
		Only applicable if Asymmetric Wrapped Key Exchange scheme is specified with -kx option.
		The following are the legal values:
		JWE_RSA   - for RSA-OAEP JSON Web ENcryption Compact Serialization
		JWEJS_RSA - for RSA-OAEP JSON Web Encryption JSON Serialization
		JWK_RSA   - for RSA-OAEP Json Web Key 
		JWK_RSAES - for RSA PKCS#1 JSON Web Key

	-enc (true|false), default true
		OPTIONAL. Whether the request must be encrypted (true) or not (false).

	-sig (true|false), default true
		OPTIONAL. Whether the request must be HMAC'ed (true) or not (false).

	-nrep (true|false), default false
		OPTIONAL. Whether the request must be marked as non-replayable (true) or not (false).

	-if <input-payload_file>
		OPTIONAL. Path to the existing file with the request payload. If omitted, either
		payload must be specified with "-msg" option or a no-payload message will be sent.

	-of <output-payload_file>
		OPTIONAL. Path to the non-existing file to which the response payload shall be written.
		If omitted, the response payload will be written to stdout.

	-msg <request-payload-text>
		OPTIONAL. The one-line text to be sent as a message payload. If omitted, either
		payload must be specified with "-if" option or a no-payload message will be sent.

	-v (true|false), default false
		OPTIONAL. Whether to turn verbose mode on (true) or off (false). Diagnostic messages
		will be dumped to stdout in verbose mode.

	-help
		Printing help to stdout. Must be specified as a stand-alone command-line option or at
		the "cmd>" prompt in interactive mode. Any other options will be ignored and no message
	 	will be sent.

	-list
		Interactive mode only. List currently selected options. Must be specified as a
		stand-alone option at the "cmd>" prompt. Any other options will be ignored and no
		message will be sent.

	-q
		Interactive mode only. Entered from the "cmd>" prompt to quit mslclient program.

ENVIRONMENT
	No environment variables are required.
	
EXIT CODES
	Exit codes are to facilitate embedding mslclient into scripts.

	0 - success. In interactive mode exit code is always 0. The rest of the exit codes only apply to non-interactive mode.

	1 - invalid command-line arguments.

	2 - configuration file reading and/or validation error.

	3 - exception from MSL core protocol stack.

	4 - MSL protocol error: Error header in MSL response

	5 - server communication error

	6 - internal execution error
